# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for new students in the bootcamp program. We built this to introduce us to concepts and lessons we will be learning throughout the year. We were taught basics on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This study guide contains notes on the different topics we learned through the prework. There is a section for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If we open the DevTools console in  Chrome by pressing Control+Shift+I, a panel should open on the side with a list of topics we have notes on. It also provides a convient suggestion on which topic to study first.
